                <p>The Year is 2030.</p>
                <p>Climate collapse has accelerated. Megacities face extreme heatwaves, flodding, and ecosystem collapse - while rural areas grapple with desertification and biodiversity loss.</p>
                <p>Governments and corporations are locked in bureaucratic paralysis, and traditional environmental policies are too slow to adapt.</p>
                <p>How might we use AI to mediate between human and ecological needs in urban spaces?</p>
                <p>Create a citu-scale AI that works between humans, wildlife, and climate systems - balancing urbn needs with ecological repair in real-time.</p>

                    <h3>1.Foot traffic and human intervention</h3>
                    <p>Human foot traffic often creates desire paths.The number of people walking through an area. Example: Too much foot traffic can damage grass or natural habitats. People across the grass in unofficial trails formed by repeated walking, usually the shortest or most convenient route between two points.</p>

                    <h3>2.Urban heat island effect</h3>
                    <p>Cities tend to be significantly hotter than nearby rural areas because urban materials such as concrete, asphalt, and brick absorb and retain heat throughout the day, then slowly release it at night. In contrast to the natural landscapes found in the countryside, urban environments often lack sufficient green spaces like parks, trees, and vegetation, which naturally cool the air through shade and evaporation. </p>

                    <h3>3.Water inaccessibility</h3>
                    <p>When people, animals, or plants lack reliable and convenient access to clean, fresh water needed for survival and healthy living. This can lead to dehydration, poor health, and even the inability to thrive in certain environments. For example, a park that lacks water features such as fountains, ponds, or irrigation systems may become too dry to support certain types of plants or attract wildlife. </p>

                <section class="prob4">
                    <h3>4.Pollution</h3>
                    <p>Such as improper waste disposal / garbage accumulation. In some areas, the lack of sufficient garbage bins leads people to discard their waste directly onto the streets. This careless disposal not only creates unsightly and unhygienic public spaces but also poses serious threats to the environment we live in. Over time, accumulated waste can release harmful chemicals into the soil and water, contributing to pollution and potentially affecting human and animal health.</p>
